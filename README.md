# U.S Oyster Imports and Landings

By: Jorge Schmidt

# Overview

This repository contains data and code to build a dataset of landings of fresh 
oysters from 1950 to 2024, inclusive, and calculates inflation-adjusted prices.
It is intended to support feasibility analyses for potential oyster farms on
the U.S. mainland.

Data sources:
The landings data [FOSS_landings.xlsx] was obtained from
https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss/f?p=215:200:7482903932446

The inflation data [CPIAUCSL.csv] was obtained from
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL

The final data [file name] combines information from the files 
FOSS_landings.xlsx and CPIAUCSL.csv.

The analysis is meant to:
1. describe historical trends (volume and pricing) in U.S. landings of fresh oysters;
2. analyze inflation-adjusted pricing and volumes by state and species.

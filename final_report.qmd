## Introduction

This repository contains data and code to build a dataset of landings of fresh 
oysters from 1950 to 2024, inclusive, calculates weighed-average 
inflation-adjusted prices, and breaks out data for the top five producing states. It includes and aggregates all reported oyster species in NOAA records.

## Objectives

It is intended to support decision-making in the oyster production and distribution sectors by displaying trends in volumes and prices.

## Data Sources

The data for oyster landings volumes and historical prices comes from NOAA. The data to calculate the adjustments for inflation comes from the St. Louis Fed (FRED).

## Data Processing

1. The file from NOAA contains 1,767 yearly observations (rows) and 11 columns (year + 10 variables). Some of the data is redundant (common and scientific names, and tsn), adds imprecision (metric tons and lbs), or is irrelevant for the purposes of this analysis (collection, confidentiality, source).

2. The file from FRED contains 908 monthly observations (rows) and two columns (date and CPI value).

3. Initial processing included cleaning up file names, filtering, grouping and/or summarizing, and exporting the data.

4. Further processing included plotting data and a spatial visualization.

## Main Findings

# Volumes

Oyster landings in the U.S. have declined from a maximum of 82.2 million pounds in 1952 to 19.4 million pounds in 2024. 

@fig-landingsvol shows the volume trend.

# Inflation-adjusted price of oyster meat

For many decades and most of the time period studied, the inflation-adjusted price of oyster meat fluctuated between \$5.00 and \$7.50. In 2013, the price began to rise significantly from this previous range and reached a high of \$12.10 in 2023.

@fig-landingsprice shows the price trend.

# Top five producing U.S. states

From 1950 through 2024, the top five oyster producing states, as measured by inflation-adjusted value of the landings, were (in descending order): Louisiana, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, and Texas. The most consistent producers over this time period were Washington and Louisiana. Texas, Virginia, and Maryland all had gaps with no reported production.

@fig-topfive shows the comparison.
